          <p>When you think of witchcraft and witch trials, you might think of the infamous Salem witch trials, which took place between 1692 and 1693. In total, 200 people were accused and 25 died. </p>
           <p>In Scotland, the period of persecution of witches was much longer, and much more deadly. The University of Edinburgh created a database of people accused of witchcraft in Scotland between and 1563 and 1736. They have identified 3,837 people accused of witchcraft. The fates of only 305 witches were recorded, but of those, 205 were executed. </p>

          <p>You also might think of witchcraft trials in Europe as rather medieval. However, this is a misconception. These people - mostly women - were accused as witches after the end of the Middle Ages, starting with the <a href = 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/07/witchcraft-economics-reformation-catholic-protestant-market-share' target="_blank">protestant reformation</a>. </p>
          <p>They were of varying social status, age, and occupation. The most common form of torture for the witches was sleep deprivation. Fatigue-driven hallucinations caused them to confess to crimes they probably did not commit. </p>
          <p>The peaks of witch prosecutions are at the same as the five nationwide witch hunts in Scotland.</p>

          <p>In 1735, the parliament of Great Britan passed The Witchcraft Act. The act made it a crime to accuse any human of witchcraft. This ended the hunting and executing of witches in Scotland.</p>
