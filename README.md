# Scottish Witch Trials

Witchcraft in Scotland

I wished to research witchcraft in scotland and see the spread of witchcraft over time after the protestant reformation.

I used a database put together by the University of Edinburgh: http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Research/witches//

I learned how to use HTML and CSS, I learned hwo to use Bulma and how to incorporate Google Fonts with Bulma. I learned how to use Datawrapper and Flourish.

Right when I was finishing my project, I found that someone else had done some cool visualization work with the same data.  I liked how they created maps and told stories of specific witches or witch hunters. If I had more time I might like to do something like that. https://witches.is.ed.ac.uk/

I really wanted to incorporate hand drawn images and maps and graphs, but we don't have access to illustrator yet, and I really didn't have time for that.
